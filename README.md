# Sports Complex POS System (C++)

This project is a **console-based Point of Sale (POS) system** developed in **C++** for managing operations in a sports complex.

The system supports **facility bookings, membership registration, equipment rental, product sales, locker rental, payments, refunds, and sales reporting**, simulating real-world business workflows in a sports centre environment.

This project was built as part of an academic assignment and enhanced to demonstrate **object-oriented programming, file handling, validation, and basic system design concepts**.


## Features

- Membership registration with automatic expiry calculation
- Hourly court booking with **time clash detection**
- Per-entry access (gym, swimming pool, fitness studio)
- Equipment rental with deposit handling
- Merchandise & snack sales with inventory tracking
- Shopping cart and checkout system
- Promo code and member discount support
- SST (6%) calculation
- Booking cancellation and refund with stock restoration
- Daily and monthly sales reports
- Admin panel for inventory, members, bookings, and reports
- Persistent data storage using text files


## Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Storage: Text file persistence
- Libraries: STL (vector, map, algorithm, iostream, fstream)


## How to Run

1. Compile using a C++ compiler (I used Visual Studio 2022)
2. Run the command

> Note: All data (members, bookings, inventory) are saved locally using text files.


## Future Improvements

- Migrate data storage to a database (MySQL)
- Refactor booking records into structured objects
- Add user authentication and role-based access
- Convert system into a web-based application (Java Spring Boot)
